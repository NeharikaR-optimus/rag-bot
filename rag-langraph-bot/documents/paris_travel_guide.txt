Paris Travel Guide

Paris, the capital of France, is known as the "City of Light" and is one of the world's most popular tourist destinations. With its rich history, stunning architecture, world-class museums, and romantic atmosphere, Paris offers something for every traveler.

Top Attractions:

Eiffel Tower
The iconic Eiffel Tower, built in 1889, stands 324 meters tall and offers breathtaking views of the city. Visit during the day for panoramic views or at night to see the tower sparkle every hour on the hour. The tower has three levels accessible to visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels.

Louvre Museum
The world's largest art museum, the Louvre houses over 35,000 works of art, including the famous Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo. Plan to spend at least half a day here. Book tickets in advance to avoid long queues.

Notre-Dame Cathedral
This Gothic masterpiece, though currently under restoration due to the 2019 fire, remains an architectural marvel. The nearby Sainte-Chapelle with its stunning stained glass windows is a must-visit alternative.

Arc de Triomphe
Located at the western end of the Champs-Élysées, this triumphal arch honors those who fought for France. Climb to the top for spectacular views of the twelve avenues radiating from Place Charles de Gaulle.

Montmartre and Sacré-Cœur
The bohemian neighborhood of Montmartre, with its cobbled streets and artistic history, is crowned by the beautiful Sacré-Cœur Basilica. Don't miss Place du Tertre where artists still paint portraits and sell their work.
