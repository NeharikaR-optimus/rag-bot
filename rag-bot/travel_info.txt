Paris, the capital of France, is a major European city and a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy, and culture. Its 19th-century cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the River Seine. Beyond such landmarks as the Eiffel Tower and the 12th-century Gothic Notre-Dame Cathedral, the city is known for its cafe culture and designer boutiques along the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré.

For family-friendly activities in Paris, consider a visit to the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie, a large science museum with interactive exhibits suitable for children. The Luxembourg Gardens offer playgrounds, pony rides, and puppet shows. The Jardin d'Acclimatation in Bois de Boulogne has amusement rides and a small zoo. Disneyland Paris, though outside the city, is a popular option for families with young children, accessible via RER A train.

When it comes to local cuisine, Paris is famous for its pastries (croissants, macarons), cheeses, and classic dishes like Coq au Vin and Beef Bourguignon. For authentic dining experiences, explore areas like Le Marais or Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Don't miss trying crêpes from a street vendor. For family dining, many bistros offer simplified menus or smaller portions. Consider restaurants near attractions, which are often more accustomed to children.

Accommodation in Paris varies. For families, aparthotels (like Adagio Apart-hotel or Citadines) offer more space and kitchenettes. Hotels in arrondissements (districts) like the 6th (Saint-Germain-des-Prés) or the 7th (near Eiffel Tower) are popular, but can be expensive. Areas like Montparnasse (14th arrondissement) or Canal Saint-Martin offer more affordable, yet charming, options. Always check for family rooms or interconnected rooms. Airbnb rentals are also a good option for larger families.
